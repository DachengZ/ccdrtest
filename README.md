# ccdrtest
Test codes for ccdrAlgorithm, for both observation data and intervention samples on the same graph to compare performances.

"samplerun.R" is the main code. Put other files in the same folder for additional scripts to generate samples, convert between sparsebnData and graphs, and evaluate performance of ccdr solutions.
